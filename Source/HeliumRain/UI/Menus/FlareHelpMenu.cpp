Helium Rain is a game where everything is tied together. Ships and stations are built with resources that need to be mined, transported and traded.

This is a basic guide on how to How To Play Helium Rain.\n\n\
In Helium Rain you play a new company in a small colony living around a giant planet Nema.\n\n\
Your goal is to extend your company and make it an empire. For this, you will need to use a smart combination of commercial and military options. You can achieve the goal you gave yourself(be the richest, the most powerful... or the only one) just by fighting, or without ever fighting, but in some cases both will be required.\n\n\
In any case you will need to make money. The simplest method to make money is trading."))

One may automatize this process using trade routes.\n\n\
    1.Trade routes are created by clicking the \"Add new trade route\" button on the right side of the Orbital Menu.\n\n\
    2.Once in the trade route creation menu, one may first draw a list of up to 4 sectors by selecting them in the drop-down menu in the center of the screen and clicking on \"Add (X / 4)\", to the right of the drop-down menu (where X is the current number of sectors in the trade route).\n\n\
    3.Once all desired sectors have been selected this way, a small diagram appears underneath, showing each sector in order, with arrows depicting which direction the trade route will take. Sectors can be rearranged using the \"Move\" buttons under each sector's column.\n\n\
    4.Each column includes a list of Operations to be performed in that sector. Initially, only one default operation is listed per sector. Operations are added by clicking the \" * Add\" button. Each operation can be modified by clicking the \"Edit\" button; the operation's edition tab is then shown on the left side of the screen, where the type of operation, the resource involved, and the cargos' behavior can all be set. Typically the first operation of the first sector is to Buy (first drop-down menu) a Resource A (second drop-down menu). A limit in max quantity and time can both be set as well, by clicking the corresponding buttons and setting the slider that appears under each of them upon clicking. The max quantity limit will prevent cargos from loading more than a specified amount of resources. The time limit will force the cargos to start the next operation after a specified amount of days, even if they didn't fill their cargo bays.\n\n\
    5.If one sector has more than one operation, they can be ordered using the \"Move up\" and \"Move down\" buttons in each operation's setting panel. Their current order is shown in the sector's column in the form of a numbered list; that order is essential, as each operation will be performed one after the other.\n\n\
    6.\"Load\" and \"Unload\" stand for operations made with one's own stations. One may set a trade route that will buy Fuel somewhere and unload it in a sector where they have an Iron Mine; and then a second trade route that will load the Iron Mine's production, and sell it to a foreign Steelworks Station. The \"Load/Buy\" operation stands for \"Load every resources available in owned stations, and if there's still room in the cargo, buy that resource to a foreign station, if there is one selling it\". Same reasoning applies for \"Unload/Sell\".\n\n\
    7.Once an operation is set, clicking the \"Done\" button brings up options to rename the trade route, assign a fleet to it, skip the current operation manually, pause it, and reset its stats. Stats are shown there as well once a fleet has been assigned to this route. They only become informative after several cycles.\n\n\
Assigned fleets may include military vessels for defense."))

	\u2022The Economy menu (accessed from the Orbital Map) displays a given resource's supply and demand in each (already visited) sector. Typically, setting a trade route that will buy a resource where it's heavily produced and then selling it in a sector where it's heavily consumed is the way to go.\n\
	\u2022Contracts arise from real needs. If the same delivery contracts keep coming from the same sector, a trade route may work well there as well."))

Modding support in Helium Rain can enable new ships, stations, resources, sectors, or ship upgrades. They cannot add new quests, story, or new C++ functionality - if you want to modify the game sources, please follow the instructions on our public Git repository, found at https://github.com/arbonagw/HeliumRain. Source mods can't be distributed through Steamworks, and by design, a source code mod would behave as an entirely separate game - two source mods can't be combined.\n\n\
Creating mods will require the Helium Rain Mod Kit, available through the Epic Games Launcher for free. No other software is required. The Helium Rain Mod Kit doesn't provide all game assets, though about half of them are provided for reference. Helium Rain mods can then be distributed through Steamworks and applied automatically to users, but developers can make them available elsewhere to be applied manually on GOG & itch.io releases."))

To start the modding process, you will need to download the Epic Games Launcher, register, and find the Helium Rain Mod Kit at the bottom of the Store tab. Install it and make sure to remember where the mod kit is installed on your computer, as you will be working from there to set it up. Once installed, the modding SDK should have a few folders - one named \"UE_4.20\", which is the engine, and one named \"HeliumRainModKit\" - everything will happen in that second folder.\n\n\
Modding will work by creating a plugin for the game. We'll create a mod named ExampleMod for reference - make sure to always use the same name everywhere, without spaces or special characters. This mod should already exist - make sure to adapt this tutorial to your own mod, or try first with the example.\n\
A plugin has to be created in the /HeliumRainModKit/Mods folder of the SDK, and has three mandatory components : \n\n\
	\u2022A plugin file, ExampleMod.uplugin, created manually\n\
	\u2022A preview image for Steamworks, Preview.png, created manually\n\
	\u2022A content directory, that will be created through the editor\n\n\
The syntax of the plugin file is quite easy. Here is an example.\n\n\
		{\n\
			\"FileVersion\" : 3,\n\
			\"FriendlyName\" : \"Example Mod\",\n\
			\"Version\" : 1,\n\
			\"VersionName\" : \"1.0\",\n\
			\"CreatedBy\" : \"Deimos Games\",\n\
			\"CreatedByURL\" : \"http://helium-rain.com\",\n\
			\"EngineVersion\" : \"4.20.0\",\n\
			\"Description\" : \"Example mod for the Helium Rain Mod Kit\",\n\
			\"Category\" : \"User Mod\",\n\
			\"EnabledByDefault\" : true,\n\
			\"Modules\" :\n\
			[\n\
			],\n\
			\"CanContainContent\" : true\n\
		}\n\n\
Once this is done, you can launch the Unreal Engine editor right away. You don't need to decide on a great description or a kick-ass preview - you can edit both later and update the mod on Steam."))

This part assumes you are familiar with Unreal Engine 4. We won't provide our own guide, or detailed guides on how the game assets are structured.\n\
You will work a lot with the Content Browser window. Make sure a folder list panel is visible on the left side of that window - toggle it with the small button below \"Add New\" on the top left. Your mod folder should appear at this point, this is where you will work from ! You can only add content here - changes elsewhere will not be applied. You can't remove existing content or update a material - you can however copy a material to the mod folder, change it, and use it for your content.\n\
Here are some details on Helium Rain's architecture.\n\n\
	\u2022All of our gameplay data is created through what we call DataAssets. You can find many of them in the /Gameplay/Catalog folder of the Content Browser as examples - look at how they're built, and learn from that.\n\
	\u2022Ships or stations have an additional Templatefile, built with UE4's Blueprint tool. Templates let us actually design the ship and place parts. These are found in /Ships/Templates and /Stations/Templates, and are referenced from the DataAssets.\n\
	\u2022A new ship would require both a new data asset and a new template.A modified ship could only use a new data asset, and keep the base template.\n\
	\u2022A new weapon or engine would require a data asset and a StaticMesh.\n\
	\u2022New sectors only require a data asset, but can also feature an entire new level, if you add a sub - level to the Space map, and provide its name in the data asset.\n\n\
Talk with other modders on the Steam forums, or our Reddit forum, to get answers ! The source code for the game is also available if you've got questions. "))

To build a mod, you will need to open the Project Launcher window in Unreal Engine. Add a new profile using the small \"plus\" sign on the bottom right, or use the provided \"Mod\" profile.\n\
We will create a profile that \"cooks\" a \"Shipping\" \"DLC\", using a \"PAK file\" with compression, based on a previous release of the game. Let's explain all of this.\n\n\
	\u2022Cooking is the process to create a usable mod file for a packaged game. This file will be a .pak file, a compressed archive of your mod.\n\
	\u2022Make sure you pick the \"HeliumRain\" project by browsing for the HeliumRainModKit / HeliumRain.uproject file.\n\
	\u2022Make sure to set how you would like to cook to \"By the book\"\n\
	\u2022We will cook for WindowsNoEditor, and LinuxNoEditor. Please cook for the \"en\" culture.\n\
	\u2022What is called DLC here is your mod - use the name of your own mod.\n\
	\u2022The release is the name of the folder inside / Releases / -currently \"1.3.4-modkit\".\n\
	\u2022Make sure Build DLC and Include Engine Content is enabled\n\
	\u2022\"Compress Content\", \"Save packages without versions\", \"Store all content in a single file (UnrealPak)\" and \"Don't include editor content in build\" should be selected"))
